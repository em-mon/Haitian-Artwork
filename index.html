                <h3>This Haitian Artwork Analyzer is significant because it offers a 
                    tool to deepen understanding of Haitian culture through the lens of its art. 
                    Haitian art is a living archive of the nation's history, spirituality, and 
                    resilience. By analyzing colors and symbols in artworks, the project helps 
                    uncover the deeper meanings artists embed in their work—meanings often tied 
                    to Haiti’s revolutionary past, agricultural life, Vodou spirituality, and 
                    the daily experiences of survival and hope. Understanding Haitian art is 
                    crucial because it challenges long-standing stereotypes that depict 
                    Haiti solely through poverty, violence, or political instability. Historically, 
                    Vodou has been misrepresented as sinister, and Haitian culture has been 
                    simplified or exoticized for Western audiences. 
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Art fights these distortions by presenting Haiti on its own terms: vibrant, 
                    complex, and proud.</u></h3>
