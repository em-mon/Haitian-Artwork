                <h3>This Haitian Artwork Analyzer is significant because it offers a 
                    tool to deepen understanding of Haitian culture through the lens of its art. 
                    Haitian art is a living archive of the nation's history, spirituality, and 
                    resilience. By analyzing colors and symbols in artworks, the project helps 
                    uncover the deeper meanings artists embed in their work—meanings often tied 
                    to Haiti’s revolutionary past, agricultural life, Vodou spirituality, and 
                    the daily experiences of survival and hope. Understanding Haitian art is 
                    crucial because it challenges long-standing stereotypes that depict 
                    Haiti solely through poverty, violence, or political instability. Historically, 
                    Vodou has been misrepresented as sinister, and Haitian culture has been 
                    simplified or exoticized for Western audiences.

                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lwa#:~:text=Lwa%2C%20also%20called%20loa%2C%20are,(horse)%20of%20the%20lwa." target="_blank">
                    Lwa:</a> The lwa are central figures in Haitian Vodou and are often depicted in Haitian art as symbols of protection, guidance, and power. 
                    These deities are closely tied to Haitian culture, religion, and daily life, influencing not only religious practices but also the creative 
                    expressions of the Haitian people. Their representations in art help to communicate the deep connection between the spiritual world and the 
                    physical world, conveying significance through visual symbolism.

                    Vèvès:</a> Vèvès are sacred symbols in Haitian Vodou, and they hold great significance both in religious ceremonies and in Haitian art. 
                    They represent lwa and deities honored in Vodou, and link art with spirituality and tradition. Artists often incorporate vèvè-like motifs 
                    into their works to represent elements of Vodou spirituality or to give the art a symbolic depth.

                    Christian Iconography:</a> Christian iconography in Haitian art and culture is not just an expression of Catholic beliefs but also a 
                    reflection of the blending of African traditions and the role of Christianity in shaping the nation's identity. This can also be seen with how
                    each lwa is "matched" to some saint. This combination of influences has created a unique and dynamic art form that is both deeply spiritual
                    and culturally rich.
